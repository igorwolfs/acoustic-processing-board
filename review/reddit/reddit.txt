# Schematic review request: FPGA-carrier board with HS analog frontend.

Hi all,

I designed this PCB as a part of my non-destructive ultrasound testing project for materials and welds.
Main components:
- Gigabit Ethernet
- LPDDR3
- USB2.0, USB-C connector up to 480 Mbps
- a few PMOD connectors
- 35 MHz ADC with analog frontend, with 2 possible analog connectors. (input frequency is meant to be between 0.1 MHz - 10 MHz)
	- RJ45 with magnetics.
	- RJ45 with capacitors for DC isolation.

Stackup:
- 6-layer JLC3313-stackup (JLCPCB)
- SIG - GND - GND - SIG / PWR - GND - SIG
- Signals impedance matched / length matched where required.

Would be great if some of you could take a look. My main points of concern:
- The frequency roloff at my ADC frontend.
- Coupling between signal traces of the LPDDR3-peripheral. The traces are close. I only have 2 layers to route them on though and I believe this is the best I can do.
- Traces underneath RJ45 connectors with magnetics.

Thanks!
