# Possible Stackups

There are a whole bunch of stackups on jlcpcb, some have higher tolerance, some don't.

## Concerns
### Deviation from 1.6 mm stackup
Stackup is 1.5384 mm with +- 10 % tolerance and not 1.6 mm. If you can't accepts this 0.06 mmdeviation choose another stackup.

So not a tolerance issue, but an issue with stackup thickness.
- Should not really matter if the main concern is having a well-defined impedance for your transmission line.


## JLC06161H-1080

- This seems to be the cheapest stackup that has very small tolerances. The other ones are either more expensive or cheaper but have a higher tolerance.
