# LED
- Add LED's to FPGA (check pins that can drive them)
- Add buttons to FPGA

# Oscillator
- Check which other oscillators we would need
	- We have 125 MHz from the ethernet peripheral
- We need 35 MHz for the ADC
- We need 

# Connectors to power board
- Check whether it's best to put connectors above / below the board to connect to power board
- Foresee 4 PWM connectors to power board
- Check which connectors to place below FPGA board to connect to power-board.

# DDR3
- Add symbol
- Add footprint
