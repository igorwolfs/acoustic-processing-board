    "# Charge kickback\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "- Charge from the hold capacitors kicks back when the switch closes and needs a place to go\n",
    "- If there's no small capacitor or charge reservoir waiting next to the inputs to catch the discharge, LC resonance might happen with the line and you might have signal-integrity problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "- Add a small capacitor at the input to ensure a small storage space for charge"
